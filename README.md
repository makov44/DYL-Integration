## Streamlined Lead Management for Insurance Agents: A WPF Application

This WPF application revolutionizes lead management efficiency for insurance agents by automating the retrieval and processing of lead-related emails via Outlook Web Application (OWA). The application focuses on maximizing the agent's productivity by reducing manual email handling and simplifying the sending process.

**Key Features:**

* **Automated Email Retrieval:** The application periodically connects to a backend service to retrieve new leads in the form of pre-composed emails.
* **Efficient Email Queue Management:** Incoming emails are organized in a queue, allowing agents to review, edit, delete, or send them efficiently. The queue clearly displays the number of emails remaining and sent, providing real-time status updates.
* **Seamless Integration with Outlook Web:** The application leverages a built-in WebBrowser control to interact directly with OWA, ensuring a familiar and convenient user experience. 
* **Automated Email Sending:**  The application can send emails directly from the queue, automating the entire process and eliminating the need for manual intervention.
* **Bypass Review Option:**  For maximum efficiency, agents can choose to bypass email review and automatically send retrieved emails.
* **Session Management:** The application manages user sessions securely, storing and renewing authentication credentials for seamless access to backend services and OWA.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The WPF interface is intuitive and user-friendly, providing a clear overview of the email queue and easy navigation within OWA.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling and logging capabilities ensure smooth operation and provide valuable insights for troubleshooting.

**Workflow:**

1. **Login:** The agent logs in using their email credentials, establishing a secure session with the backend service and OWA.
2. **Email Retrieval:** The application periodically checks the backend for new emails containing lead information.
3. **Email Queue Management:** Retrieved emails are added to the queue, visible within the application interface.
4. **Email Review & Editing:** Agents can review individual emails, make necessary edits, and choose to send, delete, or keep them in the queue.
5. **Automated Sending:** With the "Bypass Review" option enabled, emails are automatically sent upon retrieval, minimizing manual effort.
6. **Email Status Updates:**  The application tracks email status (sent, deleted, failed), providing feedback to the backend service and updating the agent's interface accordingly.

**Benefits:**

* **Increased Efficiency:** Automated email handling frees up the agent's time, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks.
* **Improved Lead Conversion:**  Faster email processing ensures timely responses to leads, maximizing conversion rates.
* **Reduced Manual Errors:**  Automated sending eliminates potential errors associated with manual data entry and email composing.
